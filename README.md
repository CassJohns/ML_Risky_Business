## Ensemble Learning

### Questions

*Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?*

The balanced accuracy scores were:

Balanced Random Forest: .78

Easy Ensemble Classifier: .92

The **Easy Ensemble Classifier** worked the best overall in terms of balanced accuracy. 


*Which model had the best recall score?*

The recall scores were:

Balanced Random Forest: .91

Easy Ensemble Classifier: .95

The **Easy Ensemble Classifier** had the best recall score. 


*Which model had the best geometric mean score?*

The geometric mean scores were:

Balanced Random Forest: .76

Easy Ensemble Classifier: .92

The **Easy Ensemble Classifier** had the best geometric mean. 

*What are the top three features?*

The top three features were: *last payment amount*, *total received principal*, and *total payment*.  These three factors are pretty well correlated together, and are based on the payment amount.
